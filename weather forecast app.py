#Weather Forecast App in Python using the OpenWeatherMap API. Before running the code, make sure you have signed up for an API key on the OpenWeatherMap website.
#Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap. When you run the script, it will prompt you to enter a city name. It will then fetch the weather information for that city using the API and display the temperature, humidity, and weather description.
#Remember to have the requests library installed (pip install requests) before running the code.
